						About Cathrine
						
						Cathrine of Aragon was the youngest daughter of Ferdinand II and Isabel I, the founders of the Spanish nation and famous because they supported Christopher Columbus travels to what they thought would be to India, but resulted to be a journey to the discory of America.
						
						Cathrine was born the 16:th of December 1485, in Alcalá de Henares, close to Madrid, Spain.
						
						At the age of  three she was betrothal to Arthur, Henry VII son and Pince of Wales,  who was two  tyears old. 
						
						This arrangment was good for both England and Spain to calm down the tension between those two countries and Cathrine brought her huge dowry  of 200,000 ducat, with her to the marrige with Artur the Prince of Wales.
						
						So when Artur Prince of Wales dies 1502, a year after their marrige, the English reigns did not want to send back the now Princess of Wales and give back the money for the dowry. They needed a solution and that was to bethrod Cathrine with the second son, that now was the eldest, Henry. But to be able to do so, they needed Cathrine to testify that her marrige with Artur was never consumated, since there was a canon law that dictated that a man could not marry his brothers widow, so they needed a dispension from the Pope.
						
						Cathrine and Henry would still need to wait seven years before getting married for political reasons.
						
						While waiting to marry Henry, Cathrine become the Spanish Ambassador in England 1507. Cathrine was actually the first woman to become an Ambassador.
						
						1509 Cathrine marries to Henry VIII and became his first wife.
						
						During their marrige, Henry decided to wo to France for militarian reasons. 
						At this time, Cathrine was in an advanced pregnancy. Henry entitled Cathrine with the responsability to take care of Englands welfare in his ausence. 
						
						That was during Henry´s  ausence that James IV of Scotland occupies England and Cathrine, dressed in full armour went north to defend England together with Sir Thomas Lovell, a soldier and administrator and speaker of the House of  Commons.
						
						Cathrine was probably inspired by her mother, Isabel I of Castile who was a remarkable warrior during the years of unification of Spain.
						
						Sadly, and because of this battle, Cathrine lost her baby boy, but she defended England well and  defeated James IV who died in the battle.
						
						Cathrine of Aragon was 23 years when she married  Henry VIII and she was pregnant 6 times while married to Henry VIII. She delivered two sons and a daughter, but the sons died shortly after their birth or were stillborn.  Only Mary, that later would become Mary of Scotland survived.
						
						Ironically, later, it was Mary of Scotland, who went from Scotland to England to battle for the throne, but she did not had the same victory as her mother, but that is another story.
						
						Remarkbly, it was Cathrine of Aragon that  asked the author and  humanitarian philosof  Juan Luis Vives to write a book ab womens right to have an education that he called: ‘The Education of Christian Women’ published 1524 and he dedicated the book to Cathrine and facilitating the education of her daughter Mary who was born 1516.
						
						Later on, when Henry VIII wanted to divorce Cathrine of Aragon in 1527, much due to the incapability to give birth to a son that survived and because Cathrines age made it more difficult for her to become pregnant again, the dissolvment of the first marriage with Arthur by the Pope,  made it impossible to do it again. 
						
						But it was also Cathrines unwillingness to divorce Henry VIII that made the Pope of Rome reluctant of a new annulation of the second marriage.
						
						Henry VIII become desperat and did everything he could to become a singel man so he could remarry to Anne Boleyn that was alredy pregnant with his child,  and that could possible be a son this time, he hoped, and he did not want a possible son or his wedding to Anne Bolayn who he already wed in secret, to be ilegitim.
						
						Contemporary to Henry VIII, in Germany, the Catholic Church had become more and more impopular due to all corruption and the abusive hierarchy that that Church impossed to the people, and that was when Martin Luther started a revolution to break free from the Catholicism and founded a new Church in protest to the Catholicism. That was when Martin Luther founded the Protestant Church. 
						
						This was very interesting for Henry VIII who decided that he could break up with the Catholic Church too and  encouraged by  the  Archebishop of Cantebury, Tomas Cranmer,  he started the new Church of England.
						
						So Henry and Cathrines marrige was annulated, and Henry forced Cathrine out of the palace and also to leave their daughter Mary behind, to never see her again. 
						
						Cathrine lived isolated the rest of her life until she  died in cancer at the age of 50 while staying at Kimbolton Castle. Her death happened in January 1536 and her tomb is situated in Peterborough Cathedral, but before she died, she wrote Henry VIII a letter telling him that she forgave him everything and that she  still loved him  and that for her,  he still was her husband.
						In the picture above, you could see her signature beside the portrait Michael Sittow did of her
